Description
I've created a READme Generator to enhance lesson learned throughout the course to practice Inquirer.

Instruction
The user must create a basic repository including gitignore "node_modules" and license "MIT" from Github. The application requires Inquirer package, npm init, and package.json.


Hobbies
I like to explore places and try new cuisines. One of my favorite food is pasta.

Language
I've learned JavaScript throughout the course, and I'm very excited to learn more.

License
I chose "MIT"
